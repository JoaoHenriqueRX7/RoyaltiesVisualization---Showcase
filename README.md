## 🚀 Why?

Celesta Royalties Visualization + AI is an MVP built for Celesta Mining to provide a secure, flexible dashboard and an AI-powered assistant for real-time royalty oversight.
It turns complex data—like invoices, shareholder positions, and FX rates—into actionable insights, with natural-language Q&A and voice interaction.
The architecture is modular and future-proof, with FastAPI + RAG enabling chat, document parsing, and seamless scaling—finally moving the operation beyond spreadsheets.
Looking ahead, the same stack will power full ore-pipeline management and operational visualization, giving Celesta one clear view across the entire mining lifecycle.

### 💰 **Real-time financial governance**  
Executives can monitor royalties owed, paid, taxes, and FX rates in real time — no spreadsheets required.

### 🎛 **Interactive dashboards & advanced filters**  
Dynamic filtering by date, shareholder, currency, invoice — lightning fast.

### 🔐 **Enterprise-grade security**  
JWT-based authentication, RBAC, encrypted data at rest, and multi-tenant readiness.

### 🌍 **Automatic currency conversion**  
Up-to-date USD ↔ BRL exchange rates via external API — seamlessly integrated.

## 🛠️ How It’s Built (Tech Stack)

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React • Vite • Tailwind • Framer Motion |
| Charts | @nivo/bar • @nivo/pie • Recharts |
| State/Data | @tanstack/react-query • Zod |
| Backend | FastAPI • SQLAlchemy • PostgreSQL • RAG pipeline for AI assistant |
| Auth | JWT (python-jose) |
| Currency | ExchangeRate.host API + Redis cache |
| Infra | Docker containers on AWS EC2 behind an ALB |

## 🔗 Core Modules

- **User Dashboard:** key metrics, charts, and AI chat  
- **Invoices:** full CRUD, multi-share support, PDF export  
- **Shareholders:** investor management and reporting  
- **REST API:** currency conversion, royalties aggregation, AI-powered endpoints

## 🗂️ Interaction Flow

1. **Login** → JWT issued from `/auth/token`  
2. **Dashboard** loads real-time metrics + exchange rates  
3. User filters data / edits invoices or shareholders  
4. Optional: AI Chat → voice or text interaction  
5. RAG-enhanced responses streamed live
